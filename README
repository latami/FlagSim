To run, type "./FlagSim" in a directory where executable resides.

To print options, type "./flagSim -h".

Lessons learned:
- System is extremely stiff, so implicit euler would probably be better than
  explicit integrators.
- Don't connect nodes with pointers. It makes connecting nodes flexible, but
  a lot of performance is lost in pointer chasing.
- Calculating pending with faces would probably be better.
